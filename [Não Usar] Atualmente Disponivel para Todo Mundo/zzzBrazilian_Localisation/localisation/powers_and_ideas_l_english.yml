 the_swiss_confederation: "The Swiss Confederation"
 the_swiss_confederation_desc: "In 1291 the cantons of Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden banded together to escape from the Habsburg inheritance, and since then, they and the other cantons have been resolute in resisting foreign incursions on our autonomy within the Empire. Nonetheless, we still aren't a proper country but an alliance or confederation of cantons with a coordinated military policy to protect our privileges. This decentralized model helps to keep our realm responsive and stable."
 swiss_mercenaries: "Swiss Mercenaries"
 swiss_mercenaries_desc: "How many kings have had cause to shout 'Summon the Switzers' whenever there has been an assassination attempt? From the Swiss Guard who protect His Holiness in Rome to the Swiss mercenaries serving as auxiliaries and bodyguards in most of the courts of Christendom, Swiss mercenaries have proven legendary in their ability. Perhaps our native sons will give us a discount for working in our courts?"
 alpine_defensiveness: "Alpine Defensiveness"
 alpine_defensiveness_desc: "Throughout the late 13th and 14th centuries, we have been constantly repelling Habsburg (and, often, by extension, Imperial) incursions into our lands. Our mighty soldiers have played a major role in that, but the hardy, difficult terrain of our mountainous home has made invasion equally difficult."
 oasis_of_peace_and_prosperity: "Oasis of Peace and Prosperity"
 oasis_of_peace_and_prosperity_desc: "Even as the most gruesome of wars rages, there's usually little call to bring Switzerland in: after all, both sides need their Swiss mercenaries, and neither wants to be cut off. Perhaps if peace is prosperity, we should focus more on peace."
 swiss_tolerance: "Swiss Tolerance."
 swiss_tolerance_desc: "The Reformation threatens to tear our land apart. Some provinces join the Protestant movement, others Reform, and still others remain Catholic. Our land is ravaged by violence and confusion. Why must we kill each other over transubstantiation and predestination when we could turn our mountain home into a realm united once more?"
 haven_for_refugees: "Haven for Refugees"
 haven_for_refugees_desc: "Other countries shed political malcontents and authors with texts critical of their governments banned abroad. Some of these figures are quite interesting, and what harm would it do us to let them criticize their homelands from the safety of their new Alpine refuge? We will establish a tradition of Switzerland as the land where exiles can speak their mind freely."
 clockwork: "Clockwork"
 clockwork_desc: "Some fools think that clockwork is for clocks alone. When one witnesses the power of rotating gears ticking away, it's obvious that clockwork can do just about anything one wants it to do: maybe the Creator of the Universe himself wound up existence like a clock and let the gears spin on their own, ticking away the centuries. Be that as it may, Swiss clockmakers are the greatest masters of the art of clockwork in existence, barring God Himself of course."

 the_clanns: "The Clanns"
 the_clanns_desc: "The Clanns of Ireland make up a strong political body for land and family management. In smaller families, the family elected chieftan is in charge of maintaining the family and protecting their lands. Land and leadership is passed through the family electorate system of Tanistry. From the royal clanns the symbolic high king of Ireland is elected, creating a bond of union between the Irish families."

 innefectual_overlords_desc: "The English government in Dublin and their Irish Parliament puppets have been weakened as result of England's many conflicts in the Hundred Years War and the War of the Roses.

 foreign_nationals: "Foreign Nationals"
 foreign_nationals_desc: "In 1487, the Irish lord John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, invited a host from Burgundy to Dublin to support the crowning of Yorkist English pretender Lambert Simnel.

 unconquerable_ireland_desc: "No English lord could contain the will of the Irish for long. Despite all efforts, rebellion after rebellion sprouted in an attempt to displace English rule.

And, as they sail from our lands, we shall further influence resistance against the protestant imperialists to on our eastern flank."

 jihad_against_the_pagans: "Jihad Against the Pagans"
 jihad_against_the_pagans_desc: "Despite the best efforts of centuries of Sunni sultanates, West Africa is still plagued by the menace of Animistic pagans. By lifting the banner of jihad, we can cleanse our lands of the unbelievers and expand our frontiers at the same time."

 estates_of_brittany_desc: "First called in the 14th century, the Estates of Brittany allowed free men from all rungs of society, even the Third Estate, to share their grievances and petition the Duke for redress.  By calling in the Estates, we can vent some of the tension in our lands."

 breton_catholicism: "Breton Catholicism"
 breton_catholicism_desc: "The French may have claimed to be the 'eldest daughter of the Church' since the days of Clovis, but their observance is spotty and their fealty to Rome only evident when it suits them.  The Breton doesn't hide his veneration of the Blessed Virgin or his loyalty to the teachings of His Holiness and the one true Catholic Church."

 catholicon: "The Catholicon"
 catholicon_desc: "In 1464, Jehan Lagadeuc wrote the first trilingual dictionary, which contained words in Latin, Breton, and French.  This amazing book was the first dictionary in either the Breton or the French language.  By distributing copies of the Catholicon, we can show that Breton is just as much a major language as French."

 bedouin_traders_desc: "There aren't many sharply-delineated man-made borders in Arabia, and even if there were, the Bedouin would ignore them.

 italian_aristocracy_desc: "Every inch of Italian soil has been hotly contested for generations. Over the centuries the many claims of various noble houses have been meticulously documented, forged and fought over. Any foreign invader would have a very hard time making credible claims to these lands, much less actually integrating them and controlling the various parties within them."
 tracee_italienne: "Trace Italienne"
 tracee_italienne_desc: "The arrival of the cannon has changed the battlefields and sieges of Italy forever and our old medieval fortifications are no longer quite up to the task. Italian engineers have recently pioneered a new style of fortresses with thick earthen ramparts and ditches. Instead of maintaining our outdated walls we should build such fortifications as they are more suited to modern warfare."

 high_renaissance_art_and_architecture_desc: "All of Christendom watches with envy as the Italian courts overflow with some of the finest architects, artists and poets of our age.

If you can take the camel's stink and its smug grin, watch as it proves its worth many time over."
 bedouin_raiders: "Bedouin Raiders"
 bedouin_raiders_desc: "Since before the days of the Prophet, Bedouins have been experts at the art of the raid.  An army may march on its stomach, but it won't march far when our raiders take the food right out of the army's mouth through rapid hit and run seizures of their supply lines.  Pull back and let the raiders do their work and watch as the invader dies of thirst."
 arabian_horsemanship: "Arabian Horsemanship"
 arabian_horsemanship_desc: "The man who rides for pleasure or military occupation has no idea what true horsemanship is.  The Bedouin rides to trade, to eat, to live.  It should surprise no one that, in addition to the finest horses, Arabia produces the finest cavalrymen."

 enforce_tawhid_desc: "'If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah, let it be known that Allah is alive and cannot die.'  The shrines to the Prophet and his Companions lay a mockery to the wise words of Abu Bakr.  Those who worship at these shrines are guilty of shirk, of exalting Man to the level of praise only Allah is due.  If we destroy these shrines, we will enforce true tawhid, or monotheism, throughout our land and purify this holy oasis of faith of the pollution of idolatry."

After the Malla Kings fell, this tradition continued onwards with other dynasties in Nepal. Let us anoint a new Kumari to inspire our people!"
 gurkha_recruits: " The Gurkhas"
 gurkha_recruits_desc: "The Gurkhas are a tribal people mainly from the mid-western and eastern Nepali hills. They are fierce fighters and we have found that including them as irregulars with our armies brings us great success on the battlefield.

 reconquista_of_the_sea_desc: "In our frequent clashes with the dreaded corsairs of the Turkish and Barbary menaces, the thought has occurred to us that the corsairs might have the right idea about seagoing looting and pillaging of the coast, but that they are directing their predations to the wrong targets.  Piracy may be a vile sin in peacetime, but in times of war it's known as 'privateering' and that's surely another thing altogether, right?"
 ecumenical_defenders_of_christendom: "Ecumenical Defenders of Christendom."
 ecumenical_defenders_of_christendom_desc: "The Reformation has harmed our cause as German and Scandinavian knights have started murmuring questions about the nature of the Communion Host, but the always-present threat of the Turk has a way of making such disputes seem minor.  Perhaps we should focus on defending the realm and debate theology once the Saracen threat is safely at bay?"

 scourge_of_the_corsairs_desc: "The famed Turkish privateer Hayreddin Barbarossa fought many legendary encounters against the Knights, but Barbarossa was hardly the only corsair we've encountered.

Those guns allow us to conquer more rival tribes and gain even more captives to sell to the Europeans to give us the funds to buy even more guns!  Some have said that the triangle trade is immoral, but they'll change their tune when they see our new muskets and how many more slaves we can capture with them and how many more muskets we can purchase with the proceeds."

 foreign_demand_for_slaves_desc: "Every once in a while, a disquieting report surfaces that overzealous Europeans have kidnapped one of our noblemen and sent him to a fate worse than death, a horrifying voyage in shackles and a short, gruesome life in a sugar plantation.  Let's take steps to keep the Europeans satisfied with our supply of foreign captives to keep our own people safe from the horrors of slavery.

 restore_malian_suzerainity_desc: "The Mali Empire has always been a decentralized affair, a collection of towns pledging loyalty to a Mansa with the Mansa's main duties to protect the routes between them and to defend them against bandits, raiders, and invaders.  Some of our vassals have sensed blood in the water and used our period of weakness in the early 15th century to end all pretense of vassaldom.  We must first remind them of the Mansa's rightful authority if we want our Empire to regain its former glory."

Our economy, though, is used to a constant influx of gold and is more difficult to inflate."

 reclamation_of_land_desc: "The Sahara doesn't stay in one place...it can wax and wane depending on rainfall, and the habitable belt known as the Sahel we reside in can grow or shrink accordingly.

Neither he nor his fleet were ever seen again, much to the relief of his successor, Mansa Musa.  As Abubakari once thought, perhaps there is value to seeing the limits of the ocean.  Unlike when he tried it, though, this time the Mansa will stay home."

Now the Europeans clamor for a yet greater number of slaves to work in their holdings in the so-called New World.  We've had little report, but the amount of slaves they demand is truly stunning and they keep coming back, sometimes even raiding our shores and abducting our subjects.  The time has come to impose order on the slave trade and restrict the Europeans to select commercial ports where they will purchase, not steal, slaves."

In these lands such beasts, and others just as mighty, roam in great numbers. Our people know them well and many worship gods in the form of tigers, cobras or the very trees of these jungles.

The treacherous Aragonese, citing their marriage into the Hohenstaufen line, stole Sicily from us in 1282 and recently finished their violation of Papal will by usurping the title 'King of Naples' in 1442 away from our Good King René.

Can there be a better description for the Angevin realms? Once upon a time our family had to govern territories from Anjou to Albania. Today, our reach might be somewhat smaller, but the duties of a Duke of Lorraine, a Duke of Bar, a Duke of Anjou, and a Count of Provence are considerably different even when all those titles are held by the same man. By our flexibility in running vastly different realms to one common goal, we placate our subjects and create a whole that is far greater than the sum total of its parts."

 provencal_quilting: "Provençal Quilting"
 provencal_quilting_desc: "One of the things that distinguishes our tongue from French is the use of 'oc' instead of 'oui' for yes. This can be observed at any hour of the day by people shouting 'Oc! Oc!' when presented with the chance to own boutis, stuffed wholecloth quilts. These distinctive pieces of Provence's heritage can be found in any place in Europe and their quality leaves foreigners swooning. Much like the Angevin holdings have always been a quilt of different peoples and heritages yet still one distinctive whole, the boutis is a glorious metaphor for our beautiful country."

But at the same time virtually all of their nobility remained loyal to the indigenous and to both Rome and Serbian Orthodox Church - heretical Bosnian Church.

 ge_home_of_fisherfolk: "Home of the Fisherfolk"
 ge_home_of_fisherfolk_desc: "Although our lands are dominated by never-ending jungles and low hills, even they must bow before the mightiest force of nature, water. Rivers carve our landscape, not only connecting our distant communities but also providing our people with water and fish. For generations we have lived off these waters and with great pride we claim that when it comes to fishing we are second to none." 
 yam_growers: "Yam Growers" 
 yam_growers_desc: "Even though our people have always been mostly hunter gatherers, yam is one exception to that rule. A common vegetable, native to rain forests of South America and fairly easy to grow, yam is the reserve food our people grow to always have something to fall back on."  
 ge_mithology: "Land of Mythology" 
 ge_mithology_desc: "The mythology of our people is more than just storytelling, it is a way of life in and of itself. Countless stories about good and evil, heroes, warriors and wise people from the past but also animals, such as the jaguar, the most sacred of all, are passed down from one generation to the next."

 ge_jaguar_warriors_desc: "The Jaguar has always been the most sacred animal for our people. Elusive, smart, powerful and awe-inspiring, it is the embodiment of all the values from our mythology. A supreme example for our warriors to emulate.\nNever be seen, unless you want to be, never be afraid, because in the jungle nights, you are the most dangerous thing out there. When you attack, strike so fast that your prey never knows what hit them, and finally, once it's done, disappear into the endless depth of jungle.\nThat is the way of the jaguar."
 ge_establish_trade: "Open Trade Routes" 
 ge_establish_trade_desc: "For as long as we can remember our people have lived in scattered communities along the banks of countless jungle rivers. Many of these small fishing villages and communities have never had any contact with each other. This is now changing. Our people are starting to travel by rivers and trade with their distant cousins and relatives. Together with this trade our ideas and mythology can spread."

 ge_unite_the_tribes_desc: "Rumors and whispers come along the rivers. Stories of a white man coming to our shores from across the Endless Seas and a distant land. Entire villages on top of great wooden boats full of men with fire sticks. Wherever they come, death soon follows. If we are to survive this challenge, unlike any other ever encountered by our people, we must gather all our villages and communities and prepare to act as one."

 pom_idea_1_desc: "Being a busy network of lucrative trade, the Baltic Sea, and thus the Northern German coast has always been a very good place for piracy. So much so that even rulers of these small countries often participated, more or less openly. There is nothing like stealing lots of gold from one of your rivals." 
 pom_idea_2: "Pomeranian Merchants" 
 pom_idea_2_desc: "The Pomeranians have a long tradition of sailing across the Baltic Sea in search of safe havens for their ships and merchandise. Many foreigners have heard of us - from Novgorod to Constantinople."

 kaz_idea_3: "Warrior Society"

 kaz_idea_4: "Legacy of the Great Horde" 
 kaz_idea_4_desc: "Oral tradition is the basis of our society. A long time ago, our elders say, a young boy rose from nothing to become the Khan of Khans and conquered the whole world in the mere blink of a lifetime. The world still trembles from his name and it shall learn to fear the steppes once again." 
 kaz_idea_5: "Steppe Warfare" 
 kaz_idea_5_desc: "Since the dawn of time, when our forefathers knew nothing of the one God and his Prophet, steppe warfare revolved around one thing: unity of a horse and a man. In the steppe they become one, a single life, and a single fighting force. No army has ever managed to beat the steppe hit and run tactics, even the mighty Iskender fell before us."

The sense of having the first national church in the world brings us immense pride in our nation. Our religious faith has helped us maintain our identity and hope, especially with thanks to the Saint Mesrop Mashdots and his Armenian alphabet, which revolutionized the fate of our people. It was a fundamental step in strengthening Armenian statehood and identity."

 melikdom_organization: "Melikdom Organization"
 melikdom_organization_desc: "As one of the few bastions of an independent Armenian state, Armenia was governed by feudal suzerains called meliks, as the old nakharar system collapsed. The relationship between meliks and their subordinates was that of a military commanding officer and junior officer, and not of feudal lord and a serf. Peasants were often allowed to own land, were free and owned property."
 sygnakhs: "Sygnakhs"
 sygnakhs_desc: "Sygnakhs are military structures in Armenia for recruiting organizations, fortification systems, signal beacons and logistical support. Usually each melik would have his own sygnakh, but larger sygnakhs are shared by different meliks. Establishing such sygnakhs allows us to rally our troops more effectively."
 nakharar_titles: "Nakharar Titles"
 nakharar_titles_desc: "Weakened by numerous invasions and the legal reforms of kings, the nakharar structure remained virtually unchanged for many centuries and was finally eliminated during the Mongol invasions in the thirteenth century. Restoring feudal despotism is out of the question, but reviving the ancient title of our noblemen would encourage national pride."
 end_of_armenian_diaspora: "End of Armenian Diaspora"
 end_of_armenian_diaspora_desc: "Our people have been scattered far and wide, without a home to return to. The revival of the Armenian nation should encourage much of our overseas compatriots to return to their motherland!"

 bardic_literature_desc: "By reviving our ancient poetic traditions, we can stand to last the test of time. The best wars are not won often with the sword, but with poetry and prose as well. A revival in the bardic traditions would also allow us to revive the eisteddfod, a grand gathering to which were invited poets and musicians from all over the country. The winner of the yearly eisteddfod is granted a seat in the lord's council. Our poets have kept alive the Welsh spirit and their songs shall inspire us."

 cyfraith_hywel_desc: "There are calls to revive the traditional Welsh law of Hywel the Good and the old cantrefi system for governing Wales, each of which was divided into several commotes.

 unbennaeth_prydain_desc: "'The Monarchy of Britain' was an Old Welsh poem that served as a national anthem for the many medieval Welsh kingdoms. Although the specific composition is now lost, it presumably recounted the exploits of the former kings of the Britons. Reviving a new form of this composition would stoke national pride."
 economic_revival: "Economic Revival"
 economic_revival_desc: "Wales had several problems in becoming an economic power. It was restricted by its peripheral location, predominantly upland topography, poor communications and sparse population.

 west_african_idea_5: "Royal Stables"

We came from a place long forgotten to meet the previous occupants of these valleys. These weak tribes are no more but the Tupi still stand. Stronger than ever and still looking over distant horizons, our warriors fear nothing and prize a glorious death in combat above all else."

 splash_and_burn_desc: "Although our people are renown warriors of the jungles, when we had first arrived to these lands we brought with us another invention, one that had nothing to do with military matters whatsoever and yet one that has allowed us to gain dominion over all these lands, defeating and displacing their previous occupants: Agriculture. While our enemies live mostly as hunters and gatherers, always on the move from one place to another, our people lead a sedentary life, growing crops that feed many hundreds more. Slash and burn is a method of shifting agricultural cultivation that has allowed our people to clear huge swaths of land to open them up for planting." 
 cultivate_the_land: "Cultivate The Land" 
 cultivate_the_land_desc: "The Jungle is a harsh environment to live in, especially if your people wish to grow their food and not live off the land.

 head_hunters: "Head Hunters" 
 head_hunters_desc: "Conquering land from weaker peoples is the very essence of our tribe. This lifestyle has created a unique warrior code according to which capturing and not killing the enemy is the highest form of bravery and valor.

 wall_builders: "Wall Builders"

 horde_legacy_desc: "There is a long tradition on the steppes of fighting from the horseback. Children are put in the saddle before they can walk and the horse can almost seem to be a part of them. By preserving these ancient traditions we ensure that our armies are lead by men who understand the use of the Turkoman horse in combat."

 deserts_of_khiva_desc: "According to the legends of our forefathers Khiva was founded by Shem the son of the prophet Noah as he dug a well in the middle of the desert. The people who drank the water of that well shouted 'Kheyvak', sweet water. Without this water either the extreme heat during the days or the extreme cold of the Khivan nights will claim the lives of anyone in this area."

 amu_darya_desc: "You know you are getting closer to Khiva when you cross the legendary Amu Darya river. Located at the crossing of the Vakhsh and Panj rivers, this major river flows across the deserts of Khiva and into the Aral Sea. With the discovery of gold on its banks, the Amu Darya might attract unwanted expeditions to our lands."
 ichan_qala: "Ichan Qal'a"
 ichan_qala_desc: "Also known as the internal fortress of Khiva, the Ichan Qal'a was the last resting-place of caravans before crossing the desert to Persia. It has been built according to our ancient traditions of town building, a sublime example of the Muslim architecture of these lands."

 gharbians: "Gharbians"
 gharbians_desc: "Cutting ties with Delhi to found our own kingdom almost one hundred years ago has also cut off our access to men, goods and technology from the Muslim dominated northern parts of India. As our state lack any form of entrenched Muslim aristocracy we are in a precarious situation and we could end up entirely at the mercy of local Hindu nobles.\nFortunately our reputation precedes us. Tales of the riches of the Deccan are told and retold all over the Muslim world and many ambitious fortune builders seek to make the sea voyage to our ports. By using the vast riches of India to attract talented westerners, Gharbians, to our court we can ensure that our country shall never lack able men to lead our armies, collect our taxes and rule our subjects."
 legacy_of_gisu_daraz: "Legacy of Gisu Daraz"
 legacy_of_gisu_daraz_desc: "India in general and the Bahmani sultanate in particular has a history as a center of Sufi teachings. The efforts of our sultans to attract and patronize Sufi sheiks, such as the great Muhammad Gisu Daraz from all over the world is a testament to the piety and the great spiritual strength of our monarchs and our court.\nThe state adopting the Sufi concepts of spiritual sovereignty and the inclusive nature of the Sufi teachings themselves will help to create an environment where the diverse religious faiths of Gharbians and the Deccani natives alike can mix and thrive without clashes or unproductive quarrels."
 dakani_language: "Dakani Language"
 dakani_language_desc: "The Deccan is a region of many languages and cultures. The great influx of Iranians, Turanians, Afghans and Arabs into these lands has gone even further to accentuate the cosmopolitan nature of our state. While historically the Persian language has fulfilled the needs of our predecessors a new mix of local languages as well as Persian and Arabic has grown increasingly common. We should adopt this Dakani language in our court and encourage its use among our poets and administrators."
 karimis: "Karimis"
 karimis_desc: "For centuries the Indo-Egyptian trade has been handled by Egyptian based groups of traders and captains known as the Karimis. Instrumental in the day to day business of the Indian ocean trade this merchant organization is now both wealthy and powerful. From the Tamil coasts and the ports of the Swahili trading cities to the Egyptian port cities past the Gulf of Aden, Sultans, nobles and commoners alike come to buy exotic goods or borrow money for their projects from the Karimis.\nThis organization has lately come to take a very active interest in our state and we only stand to gain from cultivating our relationship with it further."

 takht_e_firoza_desc: "The first thing any guest in our royal audience chamber notices is the Turquoise Throne of our dynasty. This unique piece of royal furniture was originally donated to us by the defeated Telugu Raja Kapaya and it is in many ways the ultimate symbol of our dynasty. Exquisite and splendidly unique it embodies the riches of the Deccan and the unusual combination of styles that is the hallmark of our cosmopolitan state."
 bahmani_primogeniture: "Bahmani Primogeniture"
 bahmani_primogeniture_desc: "Our unusual practice of always passing the throne to the eldest son of the current ruler has at times created some instability in our realm as power hungry regents and opportunistic nobles initially showed little hesitation in trying to take advantage of a child ruler or in supporting an envious relative's claim to the throne. By now however the practice has become firmly institutionalized and when the time for succession comes there are very few who would oppose the true heir of our dynasty."
 madrasa_of_mahmud_gawan: "Great Madrasa of the Deccan"
 madrasa_of_mahmud_gawan_desc: "For many years now our state has drained able men from the greater Muslim world while also incorporating the best of the states that came before us. This has created a rich cosmopolitan, Deccani, culture which is neither entirely Persian, Arab, Marathi, Telugu or Kannada in nature. Creating a major Madrasa in our capital would serve to further the development of Deccani learning and would allow the world to see the greatness of our state."

The Goma, a sacred drum dance built on the mixing of Indo-Islamic and African styles and rhythms is a prime example of how we have come to accept the ways of these lands while at the same time making them our own. This is the Siddi way."

 siddi_konkani_trade_desc: "Home to bustling trade ports such as Thana, Chaul or Goa the life nerve of the Konkan coast is the Indian Ocean trade network. By making good use of the naval assets at our disposal we can ensure that we grow rich as rich as the wealthiest merchant that pays our tolls."

 siddi_expansion_of_navy_desc: "Controlling the sea has always been what we Siddis do best and our navy is one of the finest in the Indian Ocean.

 jnp_purbias_desc: "Ever since the fall of Kannauj in the 9th century this region has been home to a great number of Rajput communities. Known as Purbias, these eastern Rajputs aren't an as dominant part of society as their cousins in Rajputana and lead a slightly different kind of life. Instead of a life on horseback the Purbias have elected to sow the fields and protect their settlements on foot. It was therefore with great joy that the Purbias greeted the advent of the firearm in the Indian subcontinent. With gunpowder weapons they have become every bit as dangerous on foot as their western cousins have on horseback. Let us send our recruiters to these villages to make good use of this free expertise."
 shiraz_e_hind: "Shiraz-i Hind"
 shiraz_e_hind_desc: "Ever since the days of our first independent Sultan our rulers have done their utmost to encourage scholars, holy men, poets and artists to come and settle in our fair city. Situated at the crossroad of the northern Indian trade routes, and with holy cities such as Varanasi and Prayag close by, this has not been a difficult task and as a result Jaunpur is now a blossoming intellectual environment."
 jnp_sants_and_sufis: "Sants and Sufis"
 jnp_sants_and_sufis_desc: "Northern India has always been a magnet for religious teachers and with the advent of independent Islamic kingdoms this tradition has been carried on by the Sufi teachers and the Sant poets. Where one represents an educated approach to Islamic mysticism the other has its roots among the lower castes, often questioning the need for rituals and clerics on the whole. Together with the more traditional Gurus these mystics provide an outlet for most religious convictions and in this diversity our region has found a certain stability."
 jaunpuri_architecture: "Jaunpuri Architecture "
 jaunpuri_architecture_desc: "A prioritized task for the Sultans of the newly born kingdom Jaunpur was to create an architectural style of their own, something to mark their break from the Delhi Sultanate and from earlier dynasties. In an area as rich in both resources and existing architectural styles as our kingdom this has proven easier than anyone would have imagined."
 jnp_gangetic_plain: "Gangetic Plain"
 jnp_gangetic_plain_desc: "The plain of the Ganges river and its tributaries is in many ways the heart of northern India. Extremely fertile and densely populated this region is the source of a large portion of the manufactured goods of the subcontinent. The many trade routes that criss-cross the region then in turn take these goods to the faraway places that demand them, from Persia to China and eventually even to Europe."
