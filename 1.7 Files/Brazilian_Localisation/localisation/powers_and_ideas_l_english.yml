These lands attract all manners of merchants from west and east alike to compete and cooperate with our own merchant groups such as the itinerant Nanadesis or the Chetti merchants who travel abroad to establish their trading firms in far away ports. We must not take these traders for granted however. By establishing ports and villages that are free of taxes and tolls we may persuade domestic and foreign traders alike to keep their bases of operation in our lands rather than that of our neighbours.

With a royal mandate to create, improve and defend fortified settlements these new leaders would rely on authority bestowed on them by the state rather than ancient traditions.

Grand temple cities such as Tirupati or Madurai bear witness of extensive royal patronage. Indeed in recent times these temple complexes have been growing even more grand and monumental, with south Indian temple complexes in many ways dwarfing those that can be found in northern India.

While we are no longer restricted to the marches of Upper Assam, rice cultivation remains the backbone of our economy."

 river_warfare_desc: "The Assamese terrain and the Brahmaputra river in particular is our greatest ally against foreign invaders. Any foreign army that wishes to advance along the Brahmaputra river will have to endure the rains of summer at which point they will have to take great care not to be cut of from their supply lines along the river.

Paiks are used for defence, civil construction and military production and are an integral part of our kingdom. As our country grows however this system is in need of restructuring.

Muslim invasions from the east, by Mahmud Ghazni (1001 CE) and Mohammad Ghori (1175 CE), oppressed the Jaina community, vandalizing temples or converting them into mosques, as well as having burned Jaina libraries... but the Jains of Gujarat have survived, adapted and prospered, using their connections with Jain communities across the world to serve as a hub for both the faith and commerce."

 spice_trade: "Hub of the Indian Ocean Trade"
 spice_trade_desc: "Due to the nature of the monsoon trade winds and its geographic location, Gujarat has long served as the hub of all trade in the Indian Ocean going east.  Gujarat is an essential intermediary in east–west trade, between the Red Sea, Egypt and Malacca: Gujarati merchants were important middlemen bringing spices from the Mallaku Islands as well as silk from China, and then selling them to the Egyptians and Arabs.  Our own provinces benefit from all this market access."

 the_clanns_desc: "The Clanns of Ireland make up a strong political body for land and family management. In smaller families, the family elected chieftan is in charge of maintaining the family and protecting their lands. Land and leadership is passed through the family electorate system of Tanistry.

Over the centuries the many claims of various noble houses have been meticulously documented, forged and fought over. Any foreign invader would have a very hard time making credible claims to these lands, much less actually integrating them and controlling the various parties within them."
 tracee_italienne: "Trace Italienne"
 tracee_italienne_desc: "The arrival of the cannon has changed the battlefields and sieges of Italy forever and our old medieval fortifications are no longer quite up to the task. Italian engineers have recently pioneered a new style of fortresses with thick earthen ramparts and ditches. Instead of maintaining our outdated walls we should build such fortifications as they are more suited to modern warfare."

 arabian_horsemanship_desc: "The man who rides for pleasure or military occupation has no idea what true horsemanship is.  The Bedouin rides to trade, to eat, to live.  It should surprise no one that, in addition to the finest horses, Arabia produces the finest cavalrymen."

 enforce_tawhid_desc: "'If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah, let it be known that Allah is alive and cannot die.'  The shrines to the Prophet and his Companions lay a mockery to the wise words of Abu Bakr.  Those who worship at these shrines are guilty of shirk, of exalting Man to the level of praise only Allah is due.

After the Malla Kings fell, this tradition continued onwards with other dynasties in Nepal. Let us anoint a new Kumari to inspire our people!"

 reconquista_of_the_sea_desc: "In our frequent clashes with the dreaded corsairs of the Turkish and Barbary menaces, the thought has occurred to us that the corsairs might have the right idea about seagoing looting and pillaging of the coast, but that they are directing their predations to the wrong targets.  Piracy may be a vile sin in peacetime, but in times of war it's known as 'privateering' and that's surely another thing altogether, right?"
 ecumenical_defenders_of_christendom: "Ecumenical Defenders of Christendom."
 ecumenical_defenders_of_christendom_desc: "The Reformation has harmed our cause as German and Scandinavian knights have started murmuring questions about the nature of the Communion Host, but the always-present threat of the Turk has a way of making such disputes seem minor.

Those guns allow us to conquer more rival tribes and gain even more captives to sell to the Europeans to give us the funds to buy even more guns!  Some have said that the triangle trade is immoral, but they'll change their tune when they see our new muskets and how many more slaves we can capture with them and how many more muskets we can purchase with the proceeds."

 foreign_demand_for_slaves_desc: "Every once in a while, a disquieting report surfaces that overzealous Europeans have kidnapped one of our noblemen and sent him to a fate worse than death, a horrifying voyage in shackles and a short, gruesome life in a sugar plantation.  Let's take steps to keep the Europeans satisfied with our supply of foreign captives to keep our own people safe from the horrors of slavery.

 reclamation_of_land_desc: "The Sahara doesn't stay in one place...it can wax and wane depending on rainfall, and the habitable belt known as the Sahel we reside in can grow or shrink accordingly.  A major drought could render much of our kingdom useless desert, an addition to the Sahara where no one reigns but death.  However, in good years, we might reclaim some of the marginal land from the Sahara and make it productive again."
